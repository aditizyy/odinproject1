        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and
            cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ingredients">
        <h3>Tngredients</h3>
        <li>
            <ol>Lasagna noodles (about 9-12 sheets, depending on pan size)</ol>
            <ol>Ground beef (or a mix of beef and pork) – around 1 lb (450 g)</ol>
            <ol>Onion – 1 medium, finely chopped</ol>
            <ol>Garlic – 2-3 cloves, minced</ol>
            <ol>Tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes - about 4 cups (900 ml)</ol>
            <ol>Tomato paste – 2 tablespoons (optional, for richer sauce)</ol>
            <ol>Salt & black pepper </ol>
            <ol>Dried Italian herbs (basil, oregano, thyme)</ol>
            <ol>Fresh basil or parsley</ol>
            <ol>Red chili flakes (optional)</ol>
        </li>
    </div>
    <h3>Steps : </h3>
    <div class="steps">
        <li>
            <ol><b>Start by making the sauce</b> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce,
                tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
            </ol>
            <ol><b>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</b>We're using ricotta,
                shredded mozzarella, and parmesan—like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great
                flavor!</ol>
            <ol><b>From there, it's just an assembly job.</b>A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce,
                followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
            </ol>
            <ol><b>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</b></ol>
